# Visualizing WhatsApp chat logs

This repository contains the scripts we wrote to visualize .txt files containing WhatsApp chat history.

*whatsapp_cleanfile.R* contains the script for cleaning the file and get it ready for analysis.
'whatsapp_visualization.R* contains some visualization examples created with the ggplot2 R package.

For a step-by-step walkthrough of the code and how to obatin the files, check out the xplanatory posts on [our website](journocode.com). Part one explains the cleaning script, part two covers the visualization.
